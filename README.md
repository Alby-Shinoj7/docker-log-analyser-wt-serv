# Docker Log Aggregation Stack

This repository provides a simple docker-compose configuration for a centralized logging and monitoring stack. It includes **syslog-ng**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **cAdvisor**, and **Node Exporter**.

## Folder Structure

```
conf/
  syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf       # syslog-ng configuration
  prometheus/prometheus.yml      # Prometheus scrape configuration
  grafana/
    provisioning/
      datasources/datasource.yml # Grafana datasource for Prometheus
      dashboards/dashboard.yml   # Dashboard provisioning

logs/
  syslog-ng/                     # persistent log storage

dashboards/
  container_overview.json        # sample Grafana dashboard
```

## Usage

1. Start the stack:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Send test logs:

```bash
logger -n 127.0.0.1 -P 514 "test message from host"
```

3. Access Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (admin/admin). The `Container Overview` dashboard is preloaded.

4. Prometheus metrics are available at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

Logs collected by syslog-ng are stored under `logs/syslog-ng/`.

## Notes

- Containers are configured with the syslog logging driver to automatically forward their stdout/stderr to syslog-ng.
- Modify or add dashboards in the `dashboards/` directory and they will be automatically loaded by Grafana.

The stack fails to start because Docker Compose cannot find the "ContainerConfig" key when trying to recreate existing containers. This usually happens when the containers were created with an earlier or mismatched Docker version and their metadata is now unreadable. Removing the old containers and starting fresh usually resolves it:
```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
docker system prune --volumes -f   # optional: removes unused containers/images
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
